# cylinder-SfM
Relative pose solvers for cameras viewing cylinders. Code for the paper "Relative pose from cylinder silhouettes" presented at ACCV2024.  [Link to paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-0969-7_15)

# Running code
The method is implemented in Matlab and example uses for synthetic and real data is available in the function examples_relative_pose_conics()

# Use the alternative e3q3 solver
The third optional input to examples_relative_pose_conics() is a flag of usage of e3q3. This code is however not included in this repo but can be aquired from https://github.com/vlarsson/re3q3/
